1)	Send messages by two Processors, where each processor is going to send a User defined data type called ADDRESS TYPE  with the below given values. These data values are received by Processor 3 and 4 respectively.

a. Processor 0 sends : 316 BenRoad NC
b. Processor 1 sends : 217 CountryRoad MD

2)	Twenty Processors are going to send individual values from 1 to 20 incrementally (+1 increments) to other available processors.
a.	 The message receiving processors has to compute the output of the equation y= log (n!+2n) and print the output. Desired: Use only Loops
b.	Also compute the total time taken to finish the program.

3)	Print the N! of the numbers in the range, N ={1, 2,3…...10} 
a.	Using serial program and find the total time lapsed for the completion?
b.	Using MPI Parallel Programming, and find the total time lapsed for the completion?

4)
a.	Compute the resultant Matrix Multiplication of C=A*B in Serial Programming, and present the output C matrix and total wall clock time taken for completion of this computation?
b.	Compute the resultant Matrix Multiplication of C=A*B in Parallel Programming, and present the output C matrix and total wall clock time taken for completion of this computation?
c.	Perform the Matrix Multiplications using C=A*B using Open MP with only 12 threads and Print the Output of each thread and its operations. Print the resultant output C Matrix and the total time lapsed for completion of this computation. Highlight your answers
